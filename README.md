# Lunar-Seismic-Detection
We developed an algorithm which combined both STA/LTA and the Root Mean Square method in order to determine the arrival time for the seismic event. It uses the inherent characteristics of the individual algorithms to double check and improve the accuracy of the event detected. STA/LTA is useful for detecting impulsive changes in amplitude, however it tends to provide false positives which can be mitigated by pairing it with the RMS algorithm. The RMS algorithm is less sensitive which means it may miss seismic events. Combining the two methods can help with reducing the transmission of unwanted noise in the seismic data, which is important for data transmission of only the useful signals.
